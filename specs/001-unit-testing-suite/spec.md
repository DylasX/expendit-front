# Feature Specification: Unit Testing Suite for Expendit Front

**Feature Branch**: `001-unit-testing-suite`  
**Created**: 2025-10-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create unit testing for the complete app"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Establish Component Unit Test Coverage (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need comprehensive unit tests for all React components so that I can confidently refactor and maintain the codebase without introducing regressions. This establishes the foundation for test-driven development across the application.

**Why this priority**: Component testing is foundationalâ€”without it, developers cannot safely modify UI logic. This directly supports the constitution's Test-First Development principle and enables rapid iteration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `npm run test` on all component files and verifying that unit tests cover component rendering, prop handling, event handlers, and conditional rendering. Delivers value by preventing UI regressions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a React component with props and state, **When** the component renders, **Then** unit tests verify correct DOM output and prop types
2. **Given** a component with event handlers, **When** user interactions occur, **Then** tests verify handlers are called with correct arguments
3. **Given** a component with conditional rendering, **When** state or props change, **Then** tests verify correct branches are rendered
4. **Given** a component with hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext), **When** hooks are used, **Then** tests verify hook behavior and side effects

### User Story 2 - Establish Utility & Hook Unit Test Coverage (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need unit tests for all utility functions and custom hooks so that business logic is isolated, testable, and maintainable independently of UI components.

**Why this priority**: Utility and hook tests enable developers to test pure logic without rendering components, making tests faster and more focused. This supports the constitution's Type Safety principle by validating data transformations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `pnpm run test` on utility and hook files and verifying that tests cover normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions. Delivers value by catching logic bugs early.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a utility function with input validation, **When** called with valid and invalid inputs, **Then** tests verify correct output and error handling
2. **Given** a custom hook, **When** hook state changes, **Then** tests verify hook returns correct values and triggers side effects
3. **Given** a utility that transforms API data, **When** called with various data shapes, **Then** tests verify Zod schema validation and transformation logic

---

### User Story 3 - Establish API & Data Layer Unit Test Coverage (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need unit tests for API calls, React Query hooks, and data validation so that data integrity is guaranteed and API failures are handled gracefully.

**Why this priority**: API and data layer tests ensure the application handles network failures, invalid responses, and data transformations correctly. This directly supports the constitution's Data Integrity & Caching principle.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `pnpm run test` on API and data layer files with mocked HTTP responses and verifying that tests cover success, error, and edge cases. Delivers value by preventing data corruption and API-related bugs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a React Query hook, **When** API call succeeds, **Then** tests verify data is cached and returned correctly
2. **Given** a React Query hook, **When** API call fails, **Then** tests verify error handling and retry logic
3. **Given** API response data, **When** validated against Zod schema, **Then** tests verify schema validation passes or fails appropriately

---

### User Story 4 - Establish Form & Validation Unit Test Coverage (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need unit tests for Formik forms and Zod validation schemas so that form submission, validation, and error display work correctly across all user input scenarios.

**Why this priority**: Form tests ensure critical user interactions (data entry, submission) work reliably. This supports the constitution's Data Integrity principle by validating user input before submission.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `pnpm run test` on form components and validation schemas and verifying that tests cover valid input, invalid input, and submission flows. Delivers value by preventing invalid data submission.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Formik form, **When** user enters valid data and submits, **Then** tests verify form submission handler is called with correct data
2. **Given** a Formik form, **When** user enters invalid data, **Then** tests verify validation errors are displayed
3. **Given** a Zod schema, **When** data is validated, **Then** tests verify schema correctly accepts valid data and rejects invalid data

---

### User Story 5 - Establish Test Coverage Metrics & CI Integration (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need automated test coverage reporting and CI integration so that test coverage is tracked over time and regressions are caught before merge.

**Why this priority**: Coverage metrics and CI integration enforce the constitution's Test-First Development principle by making test quality visible and preventing untested code from being merged.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `pnpm run test:cov` and verifying coverage reports are generated, then verifying CI pipeline runs tests on every PR. Delivers value by maintaining code quality standards.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** test suite runs, **When** coverage report is generated, **Then** report shows coverage percentage by file and line
2. **Given** a PR is opened, **When** CI pipeline runs, **Then** tests execute and coverage is reported
3. **Given** coverage falls below 70%, **When** PR is reviewed, **Then** coverage report is visible to reviewers

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a component receives undefined or null props?
- How does the system handle API timeouts and network errors?
- What happens when Zod validation fails on API responses?
- How are async operations (API calls, timers) handled in tests?
- What happens when React Query cache is invalidated or cleared?
- How are form submission errors displayed and recovered from?
- What happens when a custom hook is used in multiple components simultaneously?
